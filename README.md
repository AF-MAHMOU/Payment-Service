# Stripe Payment Service

This service provides a basic payment processing system using **Stripe**. It is designed for a **microservices architecture**, where other services can interact with it to handle payments. The service supports **authentication**, **webhooks** for event handling, and integrates with **Stripe's test mode** for safe development and testing.

## Prerequisites

- **Stripe Account**: You need to have a Stripe account and create a project to obtain your **API keys**.
- **Authentication System**: This service requires an authentication system to ensure only authenticated users can make payments.
- **Email Setup**: This service uses **Nodemailer** to send email notifications. You will need to configure your email credentials for this functionality to work.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Stripe API Keys

You need to obtain your Stripe keys from the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/).

- **Secret Key (sk_test_****)**: Use the test secret key when running in test mode.
- **Webhook Token**: A secret token that will be used to verify webhook events coming from Stripe.

### 2. Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables to configure the service properly:

```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_****      # Your Stripe secret key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=wb_token      # Your Stripe webhook secret token
AUTH_SECRET_KEY=your_auth_key      # Secret key for authenticating users
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.your-email-provider.com  # Email service host (e.g., smtp.gmail.com)
EMAIL_PORT=587                    # Email service port (587 for TLS)
EMAIL_USER=your-email@example.com  # Your email username
EMAIL_PASS=your-email-password     # Your email password (or app-specific password)
```

### 3. Authentication System Integration
You can integrate this payment service with your existing authentication system, or set up your own. If you have an existing authentication system, make sure the AUTH_SECRET_KEY is used to validate user authentication tokens.

If you're building your own authentication system, ensure the authentication logic in the auth controller handles token generation, validation, and authentication before processing payment requests.

Modifying the Code
To integrate with your authentication system:

Modify the auth controller to support your chosen authentication flow (JWT, OAuth, etc.).

Ensure that the AUTH_SECRET_KEY is used to authenticate and verify user tokens.

Update the payment routes to ensure only authenticated users can access payment functionality.

### 4. Webhook Setup
Set up your Stripe webhook in the Stripe Dashboard.

Provide the Webhook URL from your service where Stripe will send events.

Use the webhook token (STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET) to validate incoming requests from Stripe and avoid tampering.

Here are some of the events that the webhook handler listens for:

payment_intent.succeeded

checkout.session.completed

payment_intent.failed

Make sure your webhook handler processes these events to update the user’s payment status and trigger any necessary business logic (e.g., order fulfillment, notification).

### 5. Email Setup with Nodemailer
This service uses Nodemailer to send email notifications (e.g., for payment success or failure). To enable email functionality, configure your email provider settings in the environment variables:

EMAIL_HOST: The SMTP server host (e.g., for Gmail, it’s smtp.gmail.com).

EMAIL_PORT: Port for the SMTP server (587 for TLS).

EMAIL_USER: The email address that will send the notifications.

EMAIL_PASS: The password for the email account. If using Gmail, consider using an app-specific password instead of your main account password for added security.

Once configured, the service will automatically send emails upon successful payments.

### 6. Test Mode
This service is set to run in test mode by default, meaning no real money will be charged. You can use the following test card details for testing payments in the Stripe test environment:

Card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242

Expiration: Any future date

CVC: Any 3 digits

You can also use different test card numbers for different scenarios, such as declined payments, 3D Secure, etc. Refer to the Stripe Test Cards documentation for more options.

### 7. Service Architecture
This service is designed for microservices architecture. The payment service communicates with other services (like user management) to authenticate users and process payments securely.

If you need to integrate with other services, ensure the authentication token is passed correctly between services for seamless interaction.

## 8. Running the Service
Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stripe-payment-service.git
cd stripe-payment-service
Install dependencies:

npm install   # or `yarn install`
Start the service:


npm start     # or `yarn start`
The service will now be running on your local environment, ready to process test payments.
